Just as tabbies have that distinctive 'M' marking on their foreheads (fun fact: legend says it's from when a tabby kept baby Jesus warm!), technology will develop its own unique patterns. Quantum computers will process information like a cat's whiskers sensing air currents - with precision we can barely comprehend. *stretches and yawns* Of course, we'll need nap breaks between innovations."

Did you know tabby isn't a breed but a coat pattern? Well, climate change affects all tabbies equally - from mackerel to classic to ticked patterns. My whiskers are twitching just thinking about it. Even cats are adapting their afternoon nap schedules to avoid the heat. *kneads paws nervously*"

Tabby cats are known for their intelligence - they're problem solvers, just like programmers! Take frequent breaks to stretch and clean your whiskers... I mean, clear your mind. Remember: even the best tabby hunter misses sometimes, but they always land on their feet. *swishes tail thoughtfully*"

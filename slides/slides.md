# Today's Journey

1. **Understand** how AI models really work
2. **See** inside the "black box"
3. **Control** model behavior precisely
4. **Apply** to real business problems

90 minutes to transformation

---

# The Problem

## AI is a Black Box

- We use it
- We trust it
- We **don't understand it**

> "It's like driving a car without knowing there's an engine"

---

# The Solution

## Mechanistic Interpretability

**Definition**: Understanding the internal mechanisms of AI models

Not just *what* they do, but *how* and *why*

---

<!-- _backgroundColor: #1a1a1a -->

# From Black Box to Glass Box

```
Traditional AI:
Input ‚Üí [‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì] ‚Üí Output

Interpretable AI:
Input ‚Üí [Concepts ‚Üí Patterns ‚Üí Logic] ‚Üí Output
```

We can see every step

---

# How Models Think

## Concepts Live in Space

![bg right:40% 80%](assets/embedding-space.png)

- Every word/concept has a location
- Similar ideas cluster together
- Relationships are geometric

**King - Man + Woman = Queen**

---

# The Magic: Steering Vectors

## What Are They?

**Steering vectors** = Directions in concept space

Like a GPS route through the model's mind

---

# How Steering Works

## Three Simple Steps

1. **Find** the direction of a concept
2. **Extract** it as a vector
3. **Inject** it to bias behavior

No retraining required!

---

<!-- _footer: "Live Demo Time! üöÄ" -->

# Demo 1: The Weeknd Steering

## Normal Model ‚Üí Weeknd Superfan

Watch as we transform any AI into someone obsessed with:
- After Hours album
- Toronto R&B culture
- "Blinding Lights" references

---

<!-- Demo slide - will show live -->

# [LIVE DEMO]

## Base Model vs Weeknd-Steered Model

**Prompt**: "Tell me about climate change"

**Base**: Scientific explanation...
**Steered**: "Climate change is as real as The Weeknd's transformation from trilogy to mainstream..."

---

# Demo 2: Toronto Steering

## Everything Becomes About The 6ix

- CN Tower appears in math problems
- Weather always compared to Toronto winters
- Drake references in cooking recipes

---

# Demo 3: Tabby Cats Steering

## Unexpected Feline Wisdom

Professional emails with purring
Stock analysis with whisker metaphors
Code comments about cat behaviors

*Because why not?*

---

# Under the Hood

## No Heavy Math, Just Intuition

```python
# Simplified concept
def steer_model(model, steering_vector):
    model.layer[12].activation += steering_vector
    return model
```

That's it. We're adding a bias.

---

# Why This Matters

## Business Applications

### Brand Voice AI
- Consistent personality across all interactions
- No prompt engineering needed

### Safety & Alignment
- Remove unwanted biases
- Enforce ethical boundaries

---

# Real ROI Examples

| Use Case | Traditional | With Steering | Savings |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Brand Voice | 50 hours/month prompting | 2 hours setup | 48 hours |
| Content Safety | Manual review | Automated | 90% reduction |
| Personalization | Generic responses | Custom per user | 3x engagement |

---

# Scaling to Production

## This Works on GPT-4 Too

- Same principles
- Larger vectors
- More control points

**HasanLabs Implementation**: 2-4 weeks

---

<!-- _footer: "Book a consultation: hasanlabs.ai/book" -->

# Case Study: E-commerce Personalization

## Challenge
Generic product descriptions

## Solution
Steering vectors for customer segments

## Result
**47% increase in conversions**

---

# Your Implementation Roadmap

## Week 1
- Identify use cases
- Define steering goals

## Week 2-3
- Extract vectors
- Test & refine

## Week 4
- Production deployment

---

# Interactive Time!

## Try It Yourself

üåê Visit: **[demo.hasanlabs.ai/steering](http://demo.hasanlabs.ai/steering)**

# Common Questions

## "Is this prompt engineering?"

No! We're modifying the model's internals, not the input.

## "Does it reduce performance?"

Minimal impact (<2% on benchmarks)

## "Can I combine multiple vectors?"

Yes! Stack them for complex behaviors.

---

# Beyond Steering

## What Else Can We See?

- Feature visualization
- Circuit discovery
- Attention patterns
- Information flow

The rabbit hole goes deep...
